# Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. It showcases the fundamental principles of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## About

The purpose of this project is to:
- Deepen my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks and their architecture.
- Implement CNN components such as convolution, pooling, and backpropagation from scratch.
- Explore the application of CNNs in tasks like image classification.

## Highlights

- Fully implemented CNN architecture using only Python and NumPy.
- Includes forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.
- Experiments with activation functions, filters, and pooling mechanisms.

## Motivation

This project was created as a learning exercise to grasp the inner workings of CNNs and their role in modern deep learning. It is intended to demonstrate my understanding and not for direct use or replication.

## Notes

- The repository serves as a documentation of my learning journey in building neural networks.
- The code is not production-ready or optimized for general use.
